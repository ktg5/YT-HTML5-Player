# NOTE FOR 1.3dev!!
Version 1.3 is a compatibility update designed to work with other scripts and plugins. This should hopefully solve the issues for most common plugins used by you (users of this script) and not having to require YouTube Redux anymore. If you'd like to report a problem with a script/plugin you use that isn't working well with this script, please send a issue! Thank you for your support and usage of this script!

## How to work.
1. [Download Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install the script [here](https://github.com/ktg5/YT-HTML5-Player/raw/dev/YT-HTML5-Player.user.js)

## User customization!
If you'd like to customize the player (color, scrubber image), edit the userscipt through the Tampermonkey dropdown menu and mess around with some of the values and such!

Some examples:
